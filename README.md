## Hi there 👋
# 👋 Hi, I'm [Your Name]

🔧 Engineer-in-training | Startup Co-founder | Flutter Developer | Marine Tech Enthusiast

Welcome to my GitHub. I’m focused on building practical and scalable systems — whether through clean Flutter apps, hardware prototyping, or leading projects with purpose.

---

## ⚙️ What I’m Working On

- 🛥️ Co-founder of a startup building a **student race boat** — hands-on with electronics, design, and systems integration
- ❤️ Building an **analog heart rate sensor** from scratch using IR + red phototransistors
- 💼 Leading the **front-end development** of a Flutter app connected to a C# back-end
- 🔬 Continuously experimenting with electronics, biosignals, and embedded systems

## 💡 Technical Stack

### 🖥️ Front-End
- **Flutter**: Modular architecture, clean design systems, scalable routing (`GoRouter`, `auto_route`)
- **State Management**:  `Provider`, `setState` (where it makes sense)
- **UI/UX**: Smooth animations, responsive layouts, component-driven design

### ☁️ Back-End Integration
- **Firebase**: Auth, Firestore, Cloud Storage, Cloud Functions
- **C# / .NET**: Connected back-end infrastructure (handled by our team)

### 🔧 Hardware + Embedded
- **Arduino**: Analog signal conditioning, biosensor design
- **Signal Processing**: Filtering and amplifying data from phototransistors

## 🧠 How I Work

- 🧠 I prioritize **deep work** — long, focused sessions where I can fully engage with the problem
- 💪 I’m very **hard-working** and take pride in understanding systems at a low level  
- 👨‍🔧 I enjoy both software and hardware challenges — especially when they connect  
- 🤝 And yes, I’m that **homie** who’s reliable, driven, and team-oriented
